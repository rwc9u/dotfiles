;;; Commentary:
;;
;; cucumber-goto-step.el is a simple helper package that navigates
;; from a step in a feature file to the step definition.  While this
;; functionality exists in cucumber.el is requires external tools.
;; This package allows the user to go directly to the step definition
;; without the use of any external tools.  It does this by finding the
;; project root then searching "/features/**/*_steps.rb" for
;; potentially matching candidates.  It relies on pcre2el to convert
;; perl style regular expressions to Emacs regular expressions.
;;
;; The easiest way to install cucumber-goto-step.el is to use a package
;; manager.  To install it manually simply add it to your load path
;; then require it.
;;
;;     (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/ack-and-a-half")
;;     (require 'ack-and-a-half)
;;
;; Once installed cucumber-goto-step can be invoked using:
;;
;;     M-x jump-to-cucumber-step
;;
;; There are a few variables you may wish to customize depending on
;; your environment.  To do this enter:
;;
;;     M-x customize-group cucumber-goto-step
;;
;; These variables include:
;; - cgs-root-markers: a list of files/directories that are found
;;   at the root of your project.
;; - cgs-step-search-path: a file global that cucumber-goto-step
;;   will search for step files.  This defaults to "/features/**/*_steps.rb".
;; - cgs-find-project-functions: a list of functions used to locate the
;;   project root.  A default function is provided however you may
;;   optionally override this is you have any special requirements.
