  narrowed part.

  If a region is active, export that region.

  A non-nil optional argument ASYNC means the process should happen
  asynchronously.  The resulting buffer should be accessible
  through the `org-export-stack' interface.

  When optional argument SUBTREEP is non-nil, export the sub-tree
  at point, extracting information from the headline properties
  first.

  When optional argument VISIBLE-ONLY is non-nil, don't export
  contents of hidden elements.

  When optional argument BODY-ONLY is non-nil, strip title and
  table of contents from output.

  EXT-PLIST, when provided, is a property list with external
  parameters overriding Org default settings, but still inferior to
  file-local settings.

  Export is done in a buffer named \"*Org SLACK Export*\", which
  will be displayed when `org-export-show-temporary-export-buffer'
