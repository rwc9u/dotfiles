  "Run whisper after ensuring installation correctness.

This is a horrible function, and in time due a rewrite. But for now I find this
amusing and a little bit instructive as to how it became a mess.

To conduct and display installation progress, `compilation-mode' is used because
it's asynchronous and most importantly capable of handling progress output
of programs like wget.  However the asynchronicity comes with some complexity
cost when more than one tasks are run (but only one after another), as there is
no built-in async/await support, so need to use callbacks instead.

That is done by adding the callback to `compilation-finish-functions'.  Arguably
it would be simpler to use one function per task and then chain these callbacks.
However personally I preferred to logically group these together and handle
synchronisation and cleaning up in one place, hence this big function.

Conventionally, these callbacks are going to be called by passing current
compilation-buffer in BUFFER and what event triggered the callback in STATUS so
that's the function signature here.  Checking if BUFFER is indeed originating
from this particular compilation buffer and not something the user have running
elsewhere is necessary.  It's possible to make the hook buffer local, but
compilation command starts before the hook could be added so I have some
theoretical concern about possible race condition in that approach.

Small Downside of re-using same function is that we need to differentiate
whether this run is a callback or first normal call, that's what the made up
status \"whisper-start\" does.

But the bigger issue I didn't think of at first is that callback model breaks
dynamic binding because call stack is disrupted. Work needs to happen when we
are coming from callbacks run from some random hook.  But then the implication
is that in such runs the free variables are no longer shadowed in dynamic scope,
so lookup fallbacks to global scope to initial non-useful values.  The messy
but easy to write workaround is to use setq-default everywhere.  That might
require reverting values in a different part of code, such spooky entanglements
are terrible although I didn't need to do that here.

Anyway, I chose that thinking passing values via function parameter is not
possible here because we are locked to this argument signature.  But that's
obviously not true, the entire callback could be defined inside a lexical scope
using something like cl-label and then inside the body the free variable would
be bound to the correct non-global value, and then they could be passed to the
downstream functions through parameters which could have done the trick."
